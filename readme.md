# Semana-OmniStack-Rocketseat

The OmniStack Week is a online workshop created by [Rocketseat](https://github.com/Rocketseat). On this workshop, ministered by [Diego Fernandes](https://github.com/diego3g), was developed a complete project (backend, frontend and mobile) to help users register NGOs and their new incidents and, thus, other users can help them.
